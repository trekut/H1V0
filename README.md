This repository contains the code and data relevant to Figure 2 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08562 "Quantum interface between single- and dual-rail optical qubits". The contents are as follows:
1. Raw quadratures obtained from the homodyne detector. First column: phase; second column: quadrature. The six datasets correspond to the six states shown in the figure.
2. Reconstructed density matrices without efficiency correction and with 50% efficiency correction.
3. Maximum-likelihood quantum state reconstruction software. Command line: MaximumLikelihood.exe [#of iterations] [photon-number cut-off] [efficiency correction (1 for no correction)] [input data with quadratures and phases] [output file name]. The algorithm is described in https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311097 and https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511044; source code can be found at http://quantech.group/quantechi. There is also a batch file for the processing of the six datasets.
4. A Wolfram Mathematica file for calculating the fidelities.
