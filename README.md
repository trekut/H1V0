This repository contains the code and data relevant to Figure 2 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08562 "Quantum interface between single- and dual-rail optical qubits". The contents are as follows:
1. Raw quadratures obtained from the homodyne detector. First column: phase; second column: quadrature.
2. Reconstructed density matrices without efficiency correction and with 50% efficiency correction.
